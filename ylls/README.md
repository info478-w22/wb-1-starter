# Years of life lost

 In this exercise, you'll use self-harm data from Colombia to consider how _deaths_ and _years of life lost_ render different pictures of disease burden at the country level. See the `analysis.R` script for instructions.

 Data was downloaded for males in **Colombia** in 2015 through the [GBD Compare tool](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/).
